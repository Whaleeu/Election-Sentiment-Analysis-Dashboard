# Election Sentiment Dashboard
The goal of this project is to create a Dashboard that tracks in real-time the sentiments of people (using twitter data) on the 3 main presidential contendant for the 2023 Nigeria Presidential Election. \
Our data source is the massive streams of data available from the Twitter API. This will allow us to create a dashboard that illustrates how people (the Twitter community) feel about each presidential contender. \



This Project is solely for learning and we do not assure that the data collected during this project represent the large population. How ever we believe this can atleast serve as a quick lookup summary for refernce as to the trending matters as regards to the three main presidential candidates.
